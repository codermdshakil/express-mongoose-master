 **1. Reading Files**

 - `fs.readFile(path, options, callback)`: Reads the entire content of a file asynchronously.
 - `fs.readFileSync(path, options)`: Reads the entire content of a file synchronously.

 **2. Writing Files**

 - `fs.writeFile(path, data, options, callback)`: Writes data to a file, replacing the file if it exists.
 - `fs.writeFileSync(path, data, options)`: Writes data to a file synchronously.
 - `fs.appendFile(path, data, options, callback)`: Appends data to a file.
 - `fs.appendFileSync(path, data, options)`: Appends data to a file synchronously.

 **3. Creating and Removing Directories**

 - `fs.mkdir(path, options, callback)`: Creates a directory asynchronously.
 - `fs.mkdirSync(path, options)`: Creates a directory synchronously.
 - `fs.rmdir(path, options, callback)`: Removes a directory asynchronously.
 - `fs.rmdirSync(path, options)`: Removes a directory synchronously.

 **4. Other Important Functions**
 - `fs.unlink(path, callback)`: Deletes a file asynchronously.
 - `fs.unlinkSync(path)`: Deletes a file synchronously.
 - `fs.rename(oldPath, newPath, callback)`: Renames a file or directory asynchronously.
 - `fs.renameSync(oldPath, newPath)`: Renames a file or directory synchronously.
 - `fs.stat(path, options, callback)`: Gets file information asynchronously.
 - `fs.statSync(path, options)`: Gets file information synchronously.
 - `fs.existsSync(path)`: Checks if a file or directory exists synchronously.

 **Key Considerations**

 - **Asynchronous vs. Synchronous:** Asynchronous methods are non-blocking and preferred for most applications to maintain responsiveness. Synchronous methods block the event loop and are better suited for scripts or initialization tasks.
 - **Error Handling:** Always include error handling to manage potential issues with file operations.
 - **File Paths:** Use relative or absolute file paths as needed for your application.
